Classification Algorithm on Diabetes dataset

**Problem Statement:** To perform classification analysis on diabetes dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Perform at least two classification algorithms.

**Tools used:** Python, Google Collaboratory, Libraries: pandas and Scikit-learn

**Algorithms used :** Knn and SVM.

**Knn Algorithm:**
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. It's easy to implement and understand, but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slows as the size of that data in use grows.
**SVM :** It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for classification and regression
challenges. Common applications of the SVM algorithm are Intrusion Detection System, Handwriting
Recognition, Protein Structure Prediction, Detecting Steganography in digital images, etc..
